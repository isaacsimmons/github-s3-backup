# Github Backup

TODO: S3 or cloud in the name? Do I care about the project name being unique?

General motiviation.
Data ownership etc.
No persistent local space.
Incremental would be nice, but meh -- your repos shouldn't be huge anyways?

Bucket setup (object versioning?)
Build it in docker
Set it up with an AWS Cron?
Integrate it into healthchecks.io

Not covering issues/wikis/etc since I don't use them
