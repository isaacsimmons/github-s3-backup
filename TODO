Make storage backend (AWS/S3) pluggable?
Support a repository name blacklist?
Repository filters out forks? filter to private/public only?
Backup org repos as well? Or starred repos?
Install just the s3 subset of the aws-sdk?
Incremental would be nice, but meh -- your repos shouldn't be huge anyways?
